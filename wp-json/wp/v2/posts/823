To view the full list of what\u2019s new to TRICARE, visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tricare.mil\/Plans\/New\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the Extended Care Health Option <strong>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tricare.mil\/Plans\/SpecialPrograms\/ECHO\">ECHO<\/a>)<\/strong>, members are now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tricare.mil\/Plans\/Eligibility\"><strong>eligible<\/strong><\/a> for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tricare.mil\/autism\"><strong>Autism Care Demonstration program<\/strong><\/a>.\u00a0 Beginning October 1, 2021, TRICARE will assign an autism-specific care manager, known as an ASN, to new members in the ECHO program. This representative will be the primary advocate for the patient.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contracting with TRICARE will also be updated.&nbsp; Effective July 1, 2021, all providers will be required to bill with a NPI including Registered Behavioral Technicians or RBTs.&nbsp; Additionally, centers or clinics must re-sign all the participation agreements by August 1, 2021, and background checks will be required to be submitted as part of the enrollment process.&nbsp; By October 1, 2021, providers will be required to attend provider education training at least annually.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Effective May 1, 2021, TRICARE will no longer be authorizing school-based services rendered by RBTs.&nbsp; Existing authorizations with approved school-based services will be allowed to continue for the duration of the authorization period.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TRICARE will continue to require treatment reviews every six months prior to authorization services.&nbsp; These reviews will require the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Baseline<ul><li>Treatment Plan with goals, targets, and recommended hours for each code<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>PDD-BI, Parent Form<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-2 (Vineland-3), The Parent Form, The Interview Form or the Teacher form are required.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2), The Parent Form is required.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Parenting Stress Index, the Parent form is required; or Stress Index for Parents of Adolescents (SIPA), The Short Form is required.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Every six months<ul><li>Treatment Plan with goals, targets, and recommended hours for each code<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>PDD-BI, Parent and Teacher Form completed by BCBA\/BCBA-D<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Parenting Stress Index, the Parent form is required; or Stress Index for Parents of Adolescents (SIPA), The Short Form is required.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Annually (in addition to six-month requirements)<ul><li>Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2), The Parent Form is required.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-2 (Vineland-3), The Parent Form, The Interview Form or the Teacher form are required.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Code Changes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Increase in allowed units for 97151 from 16 units to 32 units for initial evaluation, and up to 24 units for ongoing evaluations.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the initial evaluation, TRICARE will continue to require that all units must be used within 14 calendar days from the first date of service.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Discontinuing code T1023, which will now be billed as 97151.<\/li><li>New group codes allowed 97157 for Multiple Family Group Adaptive Behavior Treatment Guidance and 97158 for Group Adaptive Behavior Treatment by Protocol Modification.

It is imperative that providers who render services to TRICARE beneficiaries become very familiar with the policies and continually review them for updates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This blog provides a summary of updates, but should not be utilized as a comprehensive, detailed policies review or training.
