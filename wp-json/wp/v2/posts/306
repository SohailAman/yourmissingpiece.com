Despite the hurdles that come with this process, authorization management is necessary to service your patients most effectively and to increase financial efficiency within your organization. Two areas to watch out for when it comes to authorization issues are over-utilization and under-utilization. Over-utilization can result in services being provided that cannot be collected. On the other side of the coin, under-utilization of authorization can result in patients not receiving the full medically necessary services they are approved for; and to a further extent, continuous under-utilization holds the potential for reductions in future authorizations. To help reduce and even eliminate authorization issues such as these, there are three focuses we encourage you to keep at the forefront of your thought process: Consistent monitoring, clear communication, and schedule accessibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Monitoring<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important key to successful authorization management rests in actively <em>monitoring<\/em> your active authorizations. To maintain a current understanding of authorization usage, weekly status check-ins are imperative. We would encourage you to designate a single team member to be responsible for monitoring authorizations, maintaining awareness of usage, and reviewing the start and end dates. If your organization works with a revenue cycle management partner, ABA billing company, or have specialized management software, this may be a service that you can take advantage of. Maximizing begins with monitoring.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Communication<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same way that the act of monitoring can lead to successful authorization management, <em>communication<\/em> is another essential factor. Frequent communication should take place between all parties involved to ensure that neither over-utilization nor under-utilization pitfalls come into play. Including therapists, BCBA(s), administrators, caregivers, family members, and internal teams to be part of the bigger conversation is a great way to ensure everyone is on the same page. If a family is having trouble maintaining a consistent schedule, this could prevent the patient from receiving the full services for which he\/she is approved.&nbsp; Clear communication with the family may help address attendance issues and improve their understanding of the importance of utilizing the authorized services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Scheduling<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A final key to prioritize when managing authorizations&#8211;and one that goes hand in hand with the communication aspect&#8211;is <em>scheduling<\/em>. If it is possible, give your scheduling department access to authorization usage information so that adjustments can be made in accordance with timeframes and usage. Open lines of communication between the billing team and scheduling department will help ensure that scheduling complies with ABA billing rules, requirements, and other authorization usage factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite more common difficulties that come with the authorization process, prioritizing these three focuses can help reduce pain points and lost revenue from developing into larger issues. Consistently monitor. Clearly communicate. And stick to your schedule.<\/p>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>The Benefits of Receiving Prior Authorizations From Insurance Companies<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Insurance authorizations are a key part of providing services, but they can be confusing and difficult to manage in some practices. Prior authorization is a process required by many health insurance companies. Without it, the patient\u2019s procedure, medication, or service may go unpaid. In most situations involving ABA authorizations, it is critical to have a behavioral health plan that clearly demonstrates the need for these services as medically necessary for the patient. There are various steps to this process:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Verify benefits:<\/strong> The first step is to verify the provider is within the network (or considered out of network with benefits) with the insurance carrier. Providers must gather proof of insurance from the patient to start the authorization process. This process must happen before the patient receives any type of treatment or care.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Assessment authorization:<\/strong> The next step in the process involves obtaining assessment authorization through a \u201ctreatment request form.\u201d This form lists all background information about the child and the service provider. It may also include credentials and the necessary service codes for the type of therapy being provided. The correct billing codes reflect the ABA therapy including the number of hours necessary to complete the assessment.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Assessment:<\/strong> The next part of the process is an approval for the assessment. This is not a full approval to provide care, but just to provide an assessment based on the approved number of hours by the insurance provider. This step enables the provider to begin working with the patient for a formal evaluation.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Treatment plan creation:<\/strong> After the assessment, the provider then develops a treatment plan for the patient. This is an elaborate document that outlines the services to be provided along with goals for the future. The provider can meet with parents and the patient at this time to go over the treatment plan. That is an important step because it enables good communication on the expectations of care. If everyone agrees to the plan, it is then signed by all and the next step in authorization can occur.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing authorization:<\/strong> The process of obtaining authorization for ongoing care is much the same as the previous step to receive approval for the assessment. This step involves getting approval to provide care for a set number of hours over a six-month period. This may take a bit more time than other authorizations due to the need to determine if the care is medically necessary. In some situations, the insurance provider may require a peer review or live review. A case manager may want to review the treatment plan to ensure it is the best choice.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Treatment starts:<\/strong> Once authorization occurs, treatment can begin on an ongoing basis. It is possible that authorization to continue care will be necessary over time. Usually after six months of care, the authorization process must begin once more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>If your organization is looking for an ABA billing company to help alleviate the burden of managing authorizations, please contact Missing Piece Billing and Consulting today at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:weare@yourmissingpiece.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">weare@yourmissingpiece.com<\/a>&nbsp;or 765-628-7400.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Managing ABA authorizations tends to be one of the more common pain points with ABA billing.
