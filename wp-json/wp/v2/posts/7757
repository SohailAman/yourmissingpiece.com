It can often alleviate many of the frustrations you have as an ABA provider. Yet, it helps to know what to expect when you use&nbsp;insurance outsourcing services. Once you make the decision to outsource, you\u2019ll work closely with Missing Piece every step of the way to ensure the transition is as smooth as it can be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Pros and Cons of Outsourcing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You could do all of your billing and insurance-related tasks on your own. That means having time to put toward the process each week at least. This is the least expensive option, but it takes knowledge and a big time investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could also hire someone and pay him or her to do the work for you. That requires a bit more time spent managing others and providing oversight. This tends to be more expensive because you\u2019ll need to operate as an employer and pay benefits, taxes, and a salary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third option is to outsource. That means you\u2019ll pay for the services that a third party completes for you. Missing Piece works closely with you to help you get the types of services you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What to Expect From the Process<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial process requires establishing what type of work you want to be completed by your outsourcing team. This could include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Billing and collections:<\/strong>\u00a0This includes managing the bills to your clients for the care you provided. It also entails working directly with insurance companies to see that proper codes are used during that process. You\u2019ll need to follow up with payers when payments are not made, too.<\/li><li><strong>Credentialing:\u00a0<\/strong>This is the process of gaining approval to provide services to patients who use a specific insurance provider. You need to work with the insurer to assure you meet its requirements to provide care.<\/li><li><strong>Contracting:<\/strong>\u00a0Contracting is the process of setting up a legally binding contract with the insurance companies ensuring they will pay you when you provide services to their clients. This may include becoming an in-network provider for them.<\/li><li><strong>Benefits verification:<\/strong>\u00a0This process involves verifying the benefits a patient has to make sure that his or her insurance company will pay for the services provided.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll work with the third-party team to determine what specific tasks you want to be completed and what you plan to do in-house. It can be intimidating to let go of the reins and allow someone else to do this important work for you. Though when you hire a company that has expert-level professionals to provide professional assistance to you, you can trust the process. You\u2019ll have more time to focus on your patients and fewer concerns about billing codes and insurance verification questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Missing Piece Has the Expertise You Need<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance outsourcing services&nbsp;can help enhance your business operations while also working closely with you to help your practice grow.
