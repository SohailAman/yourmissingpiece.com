Insurance coverage may barely make a dent in the costs for specialized medical care, childcare, recreational needs, and other care a child with autism or other special needs may require in their lifetime.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As coverage expands for children with autism throughout the United States and autism mandates are being passed; it benefits some, but not all families.&nbsp; There are still many loopholes in coverage and self-funded plans have discretion whether they will cover members for treatment related to autism.&nbsp; For those that do have coverage, many have a significant out of pocket costs for deductibles, co-insurance and out of pocket maximums that may range between $5,000-$10,000 annually.&nbsp; Many services that are beneficial to children with autism are not considered medical and are not covered by health insurance, which leaves parents\/guardians with more expense.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As parents seek coverage for ABA therapy or other medical services for their children, many have turned to the marketplace for commercial health plans which offer coverage for autism; however, these plans may be very costly and unavailable to some.&nbsp; Other parents have turned to state Medicaid programs or other government or waiver programs for coverage, which can vary significantly from state to state.&nbsp; It is beneficial for parents\/guardians to seek out all coverage options for their child as costs continue to mount.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Tips for providers to help families with financial burdens:<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Become a Medicaid provider in your area and encourage your patients to apply for Medicaid.<\/li><li>Detailed explanations of financial obligations- knowing up front makes it easier for families to plan accordingly.<\/li><li>Encourage use of Health Savings Accounts or Flexible Spending Accounts, if possible.<\/li><li>Payment plans for patient responsibility.<\/li><li>Develop a financial hardship policy.<\/li><li>Keep abreast of community resources and refer as much as possible.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Grants may be available for children for their treatment, specialized equipment, or other needs.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Refer to these organizations for lists of available grants:<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Autism Support Network<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.autismsupportnetwork.com\/resources\/autism-grants-united-states\">http:\/\/www.autismsupportnetwork.com\/resources\/autism-grants-united-states<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Autism Speaks<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.autismspeaks.org\/autism-grants-families\">https:\/\/www.autismspeaks.org\/autism-grants-families<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>American Autism Association<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.myautism.org\/all-about-autism\/grants-and-scholarships\/\">https:\/\/www.myautism.org\/all-about-autism\/grants-and-scholarships\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The Autism Community in Action (TACA)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-the-autism-community-in-action-taca\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"u3Llt3NQuZ\"><a href=\"https:\/\/tacanow.org\/family-resources\/autism-grants\/\">Autism Grants Spreadsheet<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;
