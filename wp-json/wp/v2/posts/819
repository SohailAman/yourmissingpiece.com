Many steps are involved in the revenue cycle management process.\u00a0 Posting payments and reconciling accounts is necessary to ensure that a provider is receiving all payments to which they are entitled.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After claims are submitted to the insurance payer, they are processed and adjudicated and then, either paid or denied.&nbsp; An Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or Explanation of Payment (EOP), or a similar document, is sent to the provider and the member.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some providers may deposit the check and move on.&nbsp; However, an experienced revenue cycle expert knows that payment posting and account reconciliation is a critical step in the process for the following reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Patient Balances-<\/strong> Many claims have assigned patient responsibility.&nbsp; The account must be reconciled correctly, and balance must be billed to the patient promptly.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Reviewing Denials<\/strong>&#8211; Accurate posting of remittance or EOBs is necessary for the Accounts Receivable staff to work denied claims.&nbsp; It also helps identify problems with payers that may impact multiple patients.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Identifying Internal Issues<\/strong>&#8211; Reviewing payment and denial information will reveal &nbsp;internal process issues such as prior authorization issues or coding issues, so those issues can be prevented in the future and possibly remediated for past claims.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Reviewing Write-offs and Adjustments-<\/strong> Checking write-offs and adjustments against fee schedules and policies may also disclose errors in payments.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Secondary Claims-<\/strong> Many patients have multiple payers.&nbsp; Quick turn around of EOBs from the primary payer to secondary or even tertiary payer will result in faster complete payment of the claim.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Data Analysis-<\/strong> Compiling payment and denial information is a tool for companies to analyze their overall business operations.&nbsp; It can help with revenue forecasting and business strategy and use the information to improve overall operations.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Reconcile payments with ERAs\/EOBs-<\/strong> Reconciling the incoming checks, credit card payments, and electronic funds transfer with the statements from payers is imperative to safeguard that all funds have been received.&nbsp; Funds could have been misrouted or checks lost.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Do posting payments and managing those details seem like too much work for your practice?&nbsp; Missing Piece Billing and Consulting specializes in helping aigold therapy and behavioral health provider with the complete revenue cycle management process. &nbsp;We have an entire department focused on posting payments.&nbsp; They post payments promptly, so the Accounts Receivable team can work the outstanding claims, or the Patient Statement department can bill the patient for the balance due in a timely manner.&nbsp; This ensures that your practice is paid more quickly and more accurately.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>To learn more, set up your free Revenue Cycle Analysis review today with one of our consultants by calling <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>765-628-7400 or by emailing <\/strong><a href=\"mailto:weare@yourmissingpiece.com\"><strong>weare@yourmissingpiece.com<\/strong><\/a><strong>.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many steps are involved in the revenue cycle management process.
