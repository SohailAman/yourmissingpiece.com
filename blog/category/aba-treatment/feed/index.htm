					<description><![CDATA[<p>Initiating ABA services can be a cumbersome and time-consuming process for both the patient and the provider.  Documenting medical necessity and the need for services andthe proper consents, are a critical part of a patient’s medical record.

Payers require that services they approve and reimburse are medically necessary, and providers must have documentation to justify these services. Review these guidelines to help prepare treatment plans.  </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Medical records are a critical service piece for both patients and providers. These records document the health, well-being, medical needs, plan of care, medical necessity and treatment(s) rendered for a patient during their time with a clinician or therapist. This information is frequently reviewed by internal and external medical professionals, patients, and third-party payers. Failure to document information correctly can not only be detrimental to a patient’s care, but it can greatly impact payment for services.   </p>
